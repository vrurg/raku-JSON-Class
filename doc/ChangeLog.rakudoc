=begin item
Implement support for generic instantiations

For example, the following is now supported:

=begin code :lang<raku>
role R[::ValT, ::KeyT] is json {
    my class JDict is json(:dict(default => ValT, ValT, :keyof(KeyT))) {}
    has %.items is JDict;
}
class Rec does R[Int:D, Str:D()] {}
=end code

This change requires Rakudo compiler builds starting with
L<the commit 28ebb7ac0f5057c1a836f6bdda15fdcf76eedfd9|https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/commit/28ebb7ac0f5057c1a836f6bdda15fdcf76eedfd9>, or
starting v2023.12 releasem, when it's available.
=end item
=item Implemented lazy attribute build with C<:build> adverb of C<is json> trait for attributes; see L<I<examples/lazy-build.raku>|file:examples/lazy-build.raku>
=begin item
Don't mark type-declarator as I<explicit> if attribute's C<is json> declaration only uses C<:skip> and C<:build> adverbs.
I<Note> that using the trait without any adverb is still de-implicifying.
